The counttexruns package counts how often a LaTeX document is
compiled.

From a statistical perspective you maybe want to know how often you compiled
a document. This is exactly the task I wrote this package for. For a few
years I used a bash script and -shell-escape but now I decided to write this
small package to do the trick a little nicer.
