I downloaded the SevenSeg package a few years ago and now I noticed that the original page http://sciences-indus-cpge.papanicola.info/Afficheur-7-Segments-avec-PGF-TIKZ is not very reliable (http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/seven-segment-display/) so if this page goes down contact me and I will mirror it.

Unfortunately Germain Gondor, the author of SevenSeg didn't specify a license â€¦
